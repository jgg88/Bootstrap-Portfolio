	   <p>Joshua Gomez was raised in Ellerbe, North Carolina, a small town with a population of about 1,000. He attended the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, earning a Bachelors in Studio Art in 2012. His primary focus as an artist is oil painting. Though he explores many styles and themes of painting, from abstract to portraiture to landscapes, his body of work is most consistently surreal in nature. His most recent series features juxtapositions of animals and terrariums. For example, one of his favorite pieces, "Inhabit," shows a rhinocerus with a village nestled on his back, and the branch of a cherry blossom tree sprouts from his horn, arching overtop the body of the rhino. Gomez is still working on this series of paintings, and is simultaneous beginning work on another series that plays with bright colors, optical illusions, and a venture into photorealism.</p>

      <p>Gomez has a great interest for learning and picking up new skills, from writing, cooking, ceramics, and most recently learning the meticulous art of breadmaking, from pastries to sourdough using his own starter. Currently he has decided to take this passion for learning new skills to a new height, as he pursues computer coding. Though it is challenging, it is a highly rewarding skill, as it is exciting to understand the fundamentals of webpage design, and Gomez eagerly anticipates the paths this journey will lead him on.</p>
